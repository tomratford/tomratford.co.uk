# Hello!

Hello, my name is Tom and welcome to my Blog. I am a *statistical programmer* (which basically means I do as little statistics as possible for a job with _statistics_ in it's name). I did an undergraduate in Mathematical Sciences, which gave me a few opportunities to take Computer Science modules, as a result I've done some modules on the more mathsy parts of computer science. Namely: foundations of computation, lambda calculus, I made the horrible mistake of doing a module on [computer algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra) and then the slightly less horrible mistake of taking crytography. Essentially I have an idea about computer science but I still don't _really_ know C.

I program in my day job primarily in SAS. Which is not my favourite language. That is currently reserved for Haskell. I find myself increasingly programming in R. So you can primarily expect a healthy combination of Haskell & R on this blog, with potentially some Julia sprinkled in.

Feel free to stick around. Feedback/typos on any post can be [emailed to me](mailto:tomratford@gmail.com) so I can ammend.
